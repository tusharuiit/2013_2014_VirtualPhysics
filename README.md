I solved programming assignments in object-oriented, declarative language Modelica and applied it for computer simulation. I 
modelled electrical and mechanical systems to model a car. I used extensive modeling libraries. I created my own mechanical
modeling library. I developed a real-time simulation of an electric vehicle, in the Modelica programming language.
